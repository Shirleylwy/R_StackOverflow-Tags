### Determining the Most Popular Programming Languages and Technologies: An Analysis of Stack Overflow Data  
#### Introduction  
As developers and new learners, we often wonder which programming languages and technologies are most widely used, as well as which are gaining or losing popularity. Fortunately, we can turn to a wealth of data provided by Stack Overflow, a Q&A site with over 16 million programming-related questions. By measuring the number of questions associated with each language or technology, we can gain insight into its approximate user base.

#### Analyzing Stack Overflow Data
To examine changes in popularity over time, we will use the open data available in the Stack Exchange Data Explorer. Each question on Stack Overflow is tagged with a label that identifies its topic or technology, such as a language like R or Python, or a package like ggplot2 or pandas. By analyzing these tags, we can determine which languages and technologies are most widely used, as well as those that are growing or declining in popularity.

With this information, we can make informed decisions about which languages and technologies are most worth investing our time and energy in as developers.
